Professional services are undergoing major change – and none more so than in accountancy, where it feels like we're at a tipping point. AI is now gradually shifting roles, reworking processes, and reshaping what firms need from their people.

## The Growing Talent Gap

Since the pandemic, the profession has faced a steady decline in available talent, particularly at entry level, where firms are struggling to recruit and retain new joiners. Recent stats show that **74% of leaders believe their business is 'significantly' or 'severely' affected by a lack of skills**.

Younger professionals are increasingly attracted to careers in tech, finance, and consulting, which they often view as more dynamic or digitally forward-looking. Accountancy still battles a perception problem – seen by some as a traditional or less exciting career.

## AI and Outsourcing: A Hybrid Solution

Against this backdrop, firms are inevitably turning to AI and automation. Not to replace people, but to ensure that routine, repetitive work is covered. By shifting the burden of these tasks, firms give accountants the time and space to focus on client care, business advisory, and strategic support.

> "Think of outsourcing as adding skilled hands, and AI as adding speed and consistency – together, they create a scalable, realistic solution."

## From Compliance to Client Growth

AI is already being embedded into mainstream tools, especially within bookkeeping and reconciliation. Personal tax, corporation tax, and accounts prep are all expected to see significant automation over the next few years – though professional sign-off remains essential.

### Key Insights

- 74% of accounting leaders report significant skill shortages affecting their business
- AI adoption should focus on freeing accountants for advisory work, not replacing them
- The hybrid model of outsourcing + AI creates scalable solutions
- Larger firms are adopting a "diamond" team model with fewer entry-level roles
- Professional oversight and regulatory compliance remain non-negotiable
- Trust, auditability, and process discipline are essential for AI success

## Redefining Roles, Not Replacing Them

There's a lot of noise within the sector about AI "replacing accountants", but the reality is more nuanced. What we're seeing is a shift in roles and responsibilities, rather than a mass elimination of them. AI can take on important but time-consuming tasks, but the interpretation, insight, and relationship-building that sit at the heart of accounting remain firmly human.

Larger firms are already adopting a **"diamond" team model** – with fewer entry-level roles and more emphasis on experienced professionals with judgment, advisory skills, and client-facing strengths.

## Trust, Oversight, and Regulation

In a highly regulated profession like accounting, the success of AI depends on trust, auditability, and process discipline – areas where accountants are uniquely trained to lead. Accountants cannot abdicate responsibility simply because software drafted the first version of accounts or a tax return.

> "The real opportunity lies in combining the speed and efficiency of AI with the judgment, ethics, and accountability of human professionals."
